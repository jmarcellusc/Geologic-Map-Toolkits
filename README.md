# Geologic-Map-Toolkits

I create geologic map toolkits to streamline the process of producing accurate and detailed geologic maps. These tools are designed to automate repetitive tasks, ensure consistency, and enhance the visual quality of the final product. By using these toolkits, geologists and students can focus more on the interpretation of data and less on the manual drafting of map elements.

## List of Toolkits

Here are a start of various geologic mapping toolkits I've developed, each with a specific purpose:

### Map Neatline Toolkit
This toolkit will create either a vertical, horizontal, or all quadrangle lines that is used in the map neatlines. Tool is under revision.
#### Parameters
* **Inputs:** ---.
* **Purpose:** ---.
* **Products:** ---.

### Vector Line Quality Assuarance
This toolkit helps in the consistent representation of different rock types and stratigraphic units. It ensures that the standard geologic patterns and colors are correctly applied across the map.
#### Parameters
* **Inputs:** Select from a predefined list of lithologies (e.g., sandstone, shale, limestone) or create a custom one.
* **Purpose:** Adjust the density and size of the lithologic patterns.
* **Products:** Enter the name and age of the stratigraphic unit to be automatically included in the map key.
